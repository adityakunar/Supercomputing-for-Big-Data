# Supercomputing for Big Data 2019

In this project we studied central concepts related to efficiently using Apache Spark and the Amazon Web Services (AWS) in a practical context by analyzing a large open data set and identifying ways of processing it. The data set we used was the GDELT 2.0 Global Knowledge Graph (GKG), which indexes persons, organizations, companies, locations, themes, and even emotions from live news reports in print, broadcast and internet sources all over the world. We used this data to construct a histogram of the topics that are most popular on a given day, hopefully giving us some interesting insights into the most important themes in recent history.

This repository consists of all our code for the project. And our blog summarizing our work can be found [here](https://adityakunar.medium.com/big-data-processing-using-apache-spark-1beed579aadd).
